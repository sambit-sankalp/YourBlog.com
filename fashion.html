          <h2>The Fashion</h2>
          <h5>The cover of the world</h5>
          <h6>By:-Neha Sharma</h6>
          <p>Fashion is a form of self expression, at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. In its everyday use, the term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is trending. What is called fashion is thus that which is made available and popular by fashion system (industry and media).

            <br><br>In reaction to increased mass-production of commodities clothing at lower prices and global reach, sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.
            <br><br>As noted by fashion scholar Susan Kaiser, everyone is forced to appear, that is, there is no unmediated way of being before others. Whether we want it or not, everyone appearing before another is evaluated in relation to dress, their attire. This most commonly means how one looks, what colors, materials and silhouette one wears on the body. Even if the garments are all the same, they will appear different; if the item is washed, folded, mended, or new.

            <br><br>Fashion is a term that is plagued by its many different uses, and by the unclear application of the concept. For example, the term connotes difference, but also sameness. It signifies the latest distinction, as well as the return of the old. While it may be defined by an insular and esteemed aesthetic elite, who make a look exclusive, this look is often using references from those excluded from making the distinction.
            
            <br><br>Whereas a trend often connotes a peculiar aesthetic expression and often lasting shorter than a season, fashion is a distinctive and industry-supported expression traditionally tied to the fashion season and collections. Style is an expression that lasts over many seasons and is often connected to cultural movements and social markers, symbols, class, and culture (ex. Baroque, Rococo, etc.). According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, fashion connotes "the latest difference."
            
            <br><br>Even though the terms are often used together, fashion differs from clothing and costumes â€” "clothing" describes the material and technical garment; "costume" has come to mean fancy-dress or masquerade wear. "Fashion," by contrast, describes the social and temporal system that "activates" dress as a social signifier in a certain time and context. Philosopher Giorgio Agamben connects fashion to the current intensity of the qualitative moment, to the temporal aspect the Greek called kairos, whereas clothing belongs to the quantitative, what the Greek called Chronos.
            
            <br><br>While some exclusive brands may claim the label haute couture, the term is technically limited to members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris. Haute couture is more aspirational; inspired by art and culture, and in most cases, reserved to the economic elite.
            
            <br><br>Fashion is also a source of art, allowing people to display their own unique taste and styling. Different designers are influenced by outside stimuli and reflect this inspiration in their works. For example, Gucci's 'stained green' jeans may look like a grass stain, but to many others they display purity, freshness and summer.</p>
